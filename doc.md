Allison wanted to take an input from the open drain/collector of a cpOD/DCC-OD and drive a bi-color LED to show occupancy status. The plan is a hex inverter (7404/7407) to provide the other status
so the occupied indication is driven from the cpOD/DCC-OD and "not occupied"indication comes from the inverter. Limiting resistors are provided.
